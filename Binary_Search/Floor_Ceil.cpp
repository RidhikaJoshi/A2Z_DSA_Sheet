Problem Statement: Youâ€™re given an unsorted array arr of n integers and an integer x. Find the floor and ceiling of x in arr[0..n-1].
The floor of x is the largest element in the array which is smaller than or equal to x.
The ceiling of x is the smallest element in the array greater than or equal to x.
